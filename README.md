The meaning of this repo is to study the techniques.

Techniques are found online, on different blogs and repos here on GitHub. I do not take credit for any of the findings, thanks to all the researchers.

Rewrote them and ported it to Python 2.7. The code under _todo_ folders are not tested, do not expect it to work. 

## Techniques implemented:
* UAC bypass using fodhelper
* UAC bypass using computerdefaults
* UAC bypass using slui
* UAC bypass using silentcleanup
* UAC bypass using compmgmtlauncher
* UAC bypass using sdclt (isolatedcommand)
* UAC bypass using sdclt (App Paths)
* UAC bypass using perfmon
* UAC bypass using eventviewer
* UAC bypass using sysprep (dll payload supported)
* UAC bypass using migwiz (dll payload supported)
* UAC bypass using mcx2prov (dll payload supported)
* UAC bypass using cliconfg (dll payload supported)
* Persistence using userinit
* Persistence using image file execution option
* Persistence using hklm run
* Persistence using hkcu run
* Persistence using schtask (SYSTEM privileges)
* Persistence using explorer dll hijack
* Persistence using WMI (SYSTEM privileges)

## Installing the Dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Build:
In order for a successful build, install the py2exe (http://www.py2exe.org) module and use the provided build.py script to compile all the scripts in to a portable executable. On Windows 10, Access Denied errors can accure while compiling, rerun until success or elevate the prompt.
